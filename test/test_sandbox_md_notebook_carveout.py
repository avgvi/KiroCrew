"""The hardening that rides with the md-notebook backend's mask carve-out (#8762).

The carve-out ITSELF lives on main and is not retested here: ``_APP_BACKEND_OWNED_LEAVES``
names the hidden leaves the Notes backend owns, ``app_backend_visible_targets`` resolves
them, and ``apps/backend.py`` passes them as ``extra_visible_dirs`` for exactly that spawn
(PR #8794); a spelling beneath a foreign mask is refused by
``carveout_shadowed_by_foreign_mask`` (PR #8965). Both are pinned in
``test_sandbox_governance_mask.py``.

What this file pins is what that carve-out OPENS, and the guards that close it. Making the
three state files writable on a sandboxed host for the first time exposed two credential
paths:

* an ABSENT leaf gets no mask at all — ``mount(2)`` cannot target a missing path and the
  launcher's hiding loops guard on existence — so an agent namespace spawned before the
  first vault attach reads the PAT saved after it;
* the state writers staged their temp BESIDE the target, so a file holding the real PAT
  bytes sat at a name none of the three leaf masks covers, and a SIGKILL between write and
  rename left it readable by a same-uid agent forever.

The answers are :func:`sandbox._materialize_md_notebook_mask_targets` and the masked
top-level ``md-notebook-staging`` directory every state writer now publishes through.
